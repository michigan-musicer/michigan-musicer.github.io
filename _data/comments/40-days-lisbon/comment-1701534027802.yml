message: "You know, getting scammed, emotionally lost, and then reminiscing about childhood sounds intense-- but also very YOU, as far as I can tell. And to think there are 38 more days to cover from your trip? Yikes. Had I not known you eventually survived, I'd be hella worried. Not saying I'm not worried now, I'm just glad the souvenir was the only one getting physically damaged after all. We'll see about the emotional damage, tho... ;)\r\nAlso, just a little confirmation that the sun does, indeed, want to kill us all. Not taking any prisoners, this fella, and he's pretty consistent.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI don't think this one's sassy enough but there's not much to sass... :( waiting for the Spanish part of your viaje (I initially went with 'voyage' but my conscience said no)"
