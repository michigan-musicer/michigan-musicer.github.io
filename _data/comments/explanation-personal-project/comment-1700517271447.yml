message: "Despite the awful marketing for this post, in the exact words of: \"sad and depressing,\" this one emits hope, too! Lots of it, I'd say, not just the end. Although I seriously questioned my reading skills upon seeing the intro... that's one way to attract readers, right? I really cannot wait to see how far this project goes and what the outcome is. I hope you find all the answers you're looking forâ€” or maybe even the answers to questions you are yet to have. And, I guess, peace would be nice, too.\r\nAlso, the 'Hey Falcon, Hey Dragon' may be the coolest title for this project, hands down. let's gooo!"
