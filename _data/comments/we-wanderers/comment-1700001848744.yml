message: "I've finally read the whole post-- I took a peek once during the day but in the midst of the Tuesday chaos, I couldn't recall what I had read, but now that I'm home, I could go over it properly. And I'm glad I did just that because it suddenly feels like you're a completely different Kevin, certainly not the one adding random things to my \"words of the week\" list! \r\nFirst and foremost - thanks for adding the background piano as it nicely complemented the ambience of your writing. I may just leave the tab open so I can replay the whole 50 minutes of it.\r\nBut anyway! I was thinking of the best way to describe how the whole post made me feel, and although it initially started with \"sad and dejected,\" I can honestly say that, at least to me, it's an essay bearing hope. I truly believe the remaining time of your stay here in Poland makes it easier to seek hope-- not just the lonelier way."
