<!-- ![Kevin Wang University of British Columbia Computer Science PhD](bio-photo.jpg) -->

Hey there! I am a PhD pre-candidate in computer science in the [Systopia
Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. I am
currently coadvised by [Aastha Mehta](https://aasthakm.github.io/)
and [Nyugen Phong Hoang](https://homepage.np-tokumei.net/). I am broadly
interested in systems and network security, particularly in problems relating
to internet freedom and national security.

Before arriving at UBC, I graduated from the University of Michigan with both a
master's and bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I had the pleasure
of working with with [Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi/) and [Ram Sundara
Raman](https://ramakrishnansr.com/) on censorship measurement and with [Carol
Flannagan](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/carol-flannagan) on bias in AI
annotation in transportation research. I was a Fulbright scholar to Poland in
2023-2024, where I taught English and computer science at a small regional
university in rural Poland.

<!-- I took `musicer` as my online tag because I started university as a clarinet
performance major (and also because there are way too many Kevin Wangs
already!). If you see `musicer` mentioned elsewhere in computer science, it's
probably me :) -->
