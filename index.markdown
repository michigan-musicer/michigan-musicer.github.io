<!-- ![Kevin Wang University of British Columbia Computer Science PhD](bio-photo.jpg) -->

Hey there, thanks for stopping by! I'm Kevin Wang and I am a PhD pre-candidate
in computer science in the [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) at the
University of British Columbia. I am fortunate enough to be coadvised by 
[Aastha Mehta](https://aasthakm.github.io/) and 
[Nyugen Phong Hoang](https://homepage.np-tokumei.net/). I am broadly interested 
in systems and network security, particularly in providing citizens worldwide 
with ways to secure their right to access internet and technology.

Before arriving at UBC, I graduated from the University of Michigan with both a
master's and bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I had the pleasure
of working with with [Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi/) and 
[Ram Sundara Raman](https://ramakrishnansr.com/) on censorship measurement and 
with [Carol Flannagan](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/carol-flannagan) on 
bias in AI annotation in transportation research. I was a Fulbright scholar to
Poland in 2023-24, where I taught English and computer science at the University
of Łomża, a small regional university in rural Poland.
<!-- See my CV for full academic and employment history. -->

I took `musicer` as my online tag because I started university as a clarinet
performance major (and also because there are way too many Kevin Wangs
already!). If you see `musicer` mentioned elsewhere in computer science, it's
probably me :)

Feel free to reach out at `musicer <at> cs <dot> ubc <dot> ca`!
