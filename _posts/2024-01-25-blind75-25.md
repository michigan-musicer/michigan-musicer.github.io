Unique paths.

## Problem description

[Taken directly from LeetCode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7 \
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2 \
**Output:** 3 \
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 
1. Right -> Down -> Down 
2. Down -> Down -> Right 
3. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Solution type

Caching via DP.

## Solution

This is a DP classic and I think might've been the first problem that was showcased to us in DP. Actually no, I think staircase came first. Either way, the recurrence is just $$\textrm{ways}(i, j) = \textrm{ways}(i - 1, j) + \textrm{ways}(i, j -1)$$. If $$i = 0$$ or $$j = 0$$, that's a base case where $$ways(i, j) = 1$$, since there will only be one way to reach that cell (go straight right or down from the origin).

Not much more going on with the code here.

```python
def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
    memo = [[1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range (1, n):
            memo[i][j] = memo[i - 1][j] + memo[i][j - 1]
    return memo[-1][-1]
```
