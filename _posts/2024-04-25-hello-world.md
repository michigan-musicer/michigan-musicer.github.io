Hi there! If you're taking the time to read through my blog posts - well, first off, thanks! Second, I'm including both personal and professional posts on this same blog. If you are here to read personal essays (probably because you're a friend and I sent you said essay), feel free to ignore the posts labeled "Professional" - those probably won't be of interest. Likewise, if you are reading content I'm producing as a software professional, feel free to ignore the "personal" posts which are mostly me rambling about life and figuring out what the heck my existence means (because I can separate that quite healthily from my work at this point). 

Might say more here later, just want to leave a disclaimer for now since I am planning on expanding my audience a bit with some of my technical writeups. Of course, feel free to read what you want - just a disclaimer that I have both types on content on my little corner of the internet.
