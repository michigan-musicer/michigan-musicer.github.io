Combination sum.

## Problem description

[Taken directly from LeetCode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return _the number of possible combinations that add up to_Â `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\], target = 4 \
**Output:** 7 \
**Explanation:** \
The possible combination ways are: \
(1, 1, 1, 1) \
(1, 1, 2) \
(1, 2, 1) \
(1, 3) \
(2, 1, 1) \
(2, 2) \
(3, 1) \
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[9\], target = 3 \
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `1 <= target <= 1000`

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

## Solution type

Caching via DP.

## Solution

Caught this one pretty quickly - the base case is simply that there is one way to sum to 0 (don't use any numbers from `nums`). From there, the recursive relation is for any target value $$n$$, $$\textrm{CS}(n) = \sum_{x \in \texttt{nums}} \textrm{CS}(n -x)$$. In plain English, take the sum of the number of ways to get to $$n - x$$ for all $$x \in \texttt{nums}$$ and that's the number of ways to get $$n$$. Memoize to avoid exponential time complexity.

You can build up from 1 up to `target` like this and for a neat $$O(nt)$$ solution, where $$n$$ is the size of `nums` and $$t$$ is the value of `target`.

```python
def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    memo = [0 for _ in range(target + 1)]
    memo[0] = 1 # there is 1 way to get 0: don't use any numbers in nums
    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        numWays = 0
        for num in nums:
            numWays += memo[i - num] if i - num >= 0 else 0
        memo[i] = numWays
    return memo[target]
```

For some reason the top-down approach was way slower? As in it timed out on the larger test cases. I've checked with other solutions as well and I think that this is a correct Python implementation...the constant factors are definitely higher, and there's this additional dependency introduced on the numbers in nums -- smaller numbers will require more checks in memo, which I can see becoming a nontrivial timesink. Class functions are slow and I think using Python doesn't help.

```python
def getNumWays(self, memo: List[int], nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    numWays = 0
    if memo[target]:
        numWays = memo[target]
    else:
        for num in nums:
            numWays += self.getNumWays(memo, nums, target - num) if target - num >= 0 else 0
        memo[target] = numWays
    return numWays

def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    memo = [0 for _ in range(target + 1)]
    memo[0] = 1 # there is 1 way to get 0: don't use any numbers in nums
    return self.getNumWays(memo, nums, target)
```

Bottom-up DP works fine though, so there's no reason to fret.
