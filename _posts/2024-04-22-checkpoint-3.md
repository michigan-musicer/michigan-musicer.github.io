**PERSONAL:** a quick update because that's good for sanity and stuff.

---

I'll keep this one quick because things are getting very busy on my end.

There's always been stuff to do this year, but with job application season rolling around, it's now at the point where I need to get it done because other people are demanding it (or else I don't get a job). So unlike a lot of the "I have to stay busy!" stuff I was saying in the past, I am actually busy right now. Lots of late nights reading, coding, or writing as of late.

It's a bit startling to see how much worse I was doing in January compared to now. Something, clearly, was very wrong. I don't want to articulate right now what I think was going wrong, but it's definitely gotten much better. Here's what I will say: at some point, there was this very quiet - very *quiet*! what a weird descriptor - realization that really, as long as I get *somewhere* in the short term, there's not a lot of reason for me to worry. I trust myself to know whether or not I'm satisfied with what I'm doing in life, and if I am dissatisfied, I trust myself to change my situation for the better. I also trust the friends I have in my back corner to be there for me, to yell at me to get up when I'm down, and to pick me up when I truly cannot make it anymore.

It's also been very helpful to learn how to say "no" to myself. I can't do everything that I think I can, and I need to pick and choose which projects I want to pursue and which hurdles I want to overcome, or which hurdles I think are worth overcoming compared to the others. I think that even if I had no work to do[^0] and had all the free time in the world, I would not be able to do everything that I wanted.

[^0]: which I don't think I would like very much. Work gives a sense of purpose because work is, at the end of the day, for other people. I am very bad at being selfish.

So right now, despite the professional stress on me (simply because of the additional prep work and side projects and stuff), I'm feeling pretty okay. 

Lots of nice non-work moments in the last few months. I visited the UK and messed around at Cambridge and Oxford for a bit. I went back home and caught up with my friends and wrote an insanely long essay about it too. No traveling for a while, though; I honestly don't mind spending a month or two staying in Łomża and not having to think about travel plans and such. Unfortunately I won't have time to elaborate on them right now. Maybe some other time.

Anyway, coding club's about to start. I'm going to pick out a UK photo and put it here, then send this out. Short and sweet update.
