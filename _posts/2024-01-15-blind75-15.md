Reverse bits.

## Problem description

[Taken directly from LeetCode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 00000010100101000001111010011100 \
**Output:**    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000) \
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000010100101000001111010011100** represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is **00111001011110000010100101000000**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101 \
**Output:**   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111) \
**Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is **10111111111111111111111111111111**.

**Constraints:**

*   The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution type

Algorithmic - no specific category of solution.

## Solution

The obvious solution is to mask each bit and OR it at the appropriate position: bit 0's value is OR'd at output bit 31, bit 1's value is OR'd at output bit 30, so on and so forth. It's not the solution I am going to use because it feels too slow for the problem.

The question is how we can use bit operations to speed this up at all. It feels like you're supposed to use the negation of the bitstring? But I don't exactly get how; performing further bit operations on that bitstring is unhelpful. 

It can't be one single operation on the negation. Consider the 4-bit string `1110`, whose reverse would be `0111`. We cannot arrive at our solution by doing `1110 ? 0001` because this `?` operator, given the same inputs `(1,0)`, would have to map MSB `1` to `0` and then map the two middle `1` bits to `1`. This isn't a function. So either we cannot simply use the negation, or we cannot use bit operations alone and have to do some sort of traversal of the bitstring.

Yeah, I don't see a second operand to a possible binary operation that makes the truth table work. Except for `0111` itself, but getting that operand requires solving the problem in the first place. I'm just going to go for the easy solution.

```python
def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
    out, mask_n, mask_out = 0, 1, 1 << 31
    for i in range(32):
        if n & mask_n:
            out |= mask_out
        mask_n, mask_out = mask_n << 1, mask_out >> 1
    return out
```

Umm...this is the efficient solution apparently? It makes perfect sense after following the reasoning about the lack of possible $$O(1)$$ solutions (i.e. the fact that there's no way for us to get a working truth table on a binary operation). $$O(\log w)$$[^0] feels sensible; you need to do $$O(1)$$ work per bit in the integer. 

I guess this problem serves as a reminder not to look for solutions that aren't there. If it seems too good to be true, ask whether or not it's even possible in the first place. Establishing a lower bound would've been helpful for some of the other problems I've done.

[^0]: The problem constraints suggest that we should think of this as a constant-time algorithm because we always have a 32-bit integer. I prefer saying $$O(\log w)$$ because that generalizes better to integers of different widths.
