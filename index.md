<!-- *The court musician - jester, bard, troubadour, whichever name you prefer - is a monarch's storyteller. Their stories served not just to entertain, but also to philosophize, to challenge the listeners' preconceptions, to observe the court's virtue and vice, and to share the lives of people the monarch may never get a chance to meet.* 

*To this day, I believe stories make us human, and I would like to dedicate my life to sharing them, with software or song or plain old words, in all the courts to which I travel.*  -->

<!-- Philosophical and mildly pretentious preamble aside: hi, I'm Kevin! This is my little corner of the internet, where you can find my professional portfolio, various projects, essays, and other small creative things. -->

Hi, I'm Kevin! This is my little corner of the internet where you can find my personal projects, essays, and other small creative things.

I recently graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Michigan, and I am currently serving in Poland as an English Teaching Assistant for the Fulbright Program, an international cultural exchange program administered through the US Department of State. Right now I am teaching computer science and English language courses to students at the University of Łomża.

<!-- , and I also started and am now running the University of Łomża coding club -->

<!-- As of 6 March 2024, these are my main structured personal projects:
- an amateur history / sociology project called ["Hey Dragon, Hey Falcon"](https://michigan-musicer.github.io/categories/#hey-falcon-hey-dragon), which looks to broadly compare and contrast life in 20th-century Poland and 20th-century China
- a 100-hour custom game engine project -->
I will be looking for entry SWE positions starting in April of 2024. If you're interested by what you see here or on my portfolio, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to talk about software, particularly systems engineering and machine learning applications.

You can find some older information about me on [my old website here](https://www.michiganmusicer.com/). Over the course of the next few weeks, I will be migrating my portfolio and current information to this platform. I will also be personalizing the site's style and underlying layout over time.

The easiest way to reach me is email via `musicer@umich.edu`. If you are a student of mine at University of Łomża, please contact me using my school email - you can find it by searching up "Kevin Wang" in the school's email client.
