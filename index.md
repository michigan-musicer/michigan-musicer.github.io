Hi, I'm Kevin! This is my little corner of the internet where you can find my personal projects, essays, and other small creative things.

I recently graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Michigan, and I am currently serving in Poland as an English Teaching Assistant for the Fulbright Program, an international cultural exchange program administered through the US Department of State. Right now I am teaching computer science and English language courses to students at the University of Łomża.

I will be looking for entry SWE positions starting in April of 2024. If you're interested by what you see here or on my portfolio, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to talk about software, particularly systems engineering and machine learning applications.

The best ways to reach me are `kevin` `<at>` `musicer-kw.com` or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wang-978627196/). If you are a student of mine at University of Łomża, please contact me using the school email client.
