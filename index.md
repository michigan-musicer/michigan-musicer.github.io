title: Hello, I'm Kevin!
---

I recently graduated with a master's in computer science from the University of Michigan, and I am currently serving as an English Teaching Assistant in the US Fulbright Program in Poland. Currently I am teaching computer science courses in English to Polish students.

You can find some older information about me on [my old website here](https://www.michiganmusicer.com/). Over the course of the next few weeks, I will be migrating my portfolio and current information to this platform. I will also be personalizing the site's style and underlying layout over time.

For now, please contact me at `musicer <at> umich.edu`. One of my goals is to set up a different email for professional use.

If you are a student of mine at Akademia Łomżyńska, please contact me using my school email (`kwang <at> al.edu.pl`).
