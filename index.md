# Hello! 

I'm Kevin. I recently graduated with a master's in computer science from the University of Michigan, and I am currently serving as an English Teaching Assistant[^1] in the US Fulbright Program in Poland.

You can find some older information about me on [my old website here](https://www.michiganmusicer.com/). Over the course of the next few weeks, I will be migrating over to this platform and . My goal is for this

For now, please contact me at `musicer <at> umich.edu`. One of my goals is to set up a different email for professional use.

If you are a student of mine at Akademia Łomżyńska, please contact me using my school email (`kwang <at> al.edu.pl`).

[^1]: ...although I'm actually just teaching computer science in English :)
